      <h3 class="h3-ombre">Notes</h3>
      <p>We love comic book references and inside jokes here. Chip ID Framework was built to assist anyone that is faced with the difficult task of identifying a flash memory chip that does not have much to go on. No make or model identifiers anywhere to be found? This is the place for you. Filter down to find possible matches to what you are looking for and click on the model to be taken to either the manufacturer website or a website with the corresponding datasheet.</p>

      <p>This project was built by Katelyn Rogers, a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) professional. If you would like to connect with me, please find me on LinkedIn:<br>

      <p>I also want to give a huge shoutout to Justin Nordine, who developed OSINT Framework, for letting me use his structure and providing me with some guidance. Visit: <a href="https://osintframework.com/" target="_blank">OSINT Framework</a><br>
