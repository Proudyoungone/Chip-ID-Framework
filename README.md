## Notes
Chip ID Framework was built to assist anyone that is faces with the difficult task of identifying a flash memory chip that does not have much to go on. No make or model identifiers anywhere to be found? This is the place for you. Filter down to find possible matches to what you are looking for.

I also want to give a huge shoutout to Justin Nordine who developed OSINT Framework for letting me use his structure and providing me with some guidance. You can find OSINT Framework at the following link: https://osintframework.com/
